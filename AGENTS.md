# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Primary application code resides in `src/iva`, with domain modules such as `adapters`, `ingestion`, `llm`, `reconcile`, and the FastAPI server entry points (`server.py`, `scheduler.py`, `cli.py`). Shared schemas and models live in `src/iva/models`. Automated jobs, seeds, and helper utilities are kept in `scripts/`. Test suites are split between `tests/unit` for focused logic and `tests/e2e` for Playwright-backed flows. Supporting assets (mock documents, UX captures) are stored in `attached_assets`, while sample datasets and configuration fixtures sit under `data/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `make dev` installs Python dependencies (preferring `uv`) and Playwright Chromium binaries.
- `make run` starts the FastAPI app via Uvicorn on `PORT` (default `8080`) with autoreload.
- `make cli URL=... COMPANY=...` verifies a claim through the command-line entry point.
- `make db` seeds golden assertions from `scripts/load_golden.py`; run after schema tweaks.
- `make test` executes the full pytest suite; use `pytest tests/unit -q` for targeted runs.
- `make lint` / `make format` run Ruff linting and formatting; keep the tree clean before pushing.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.11 with 4-space indentation, type hints on public functions, and single quotes for string literals unless interpolation is needed. Modules and functions use `snake_case`, classes `PascalCase`, and constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Ruff enforces a 100-character line limit and checks `E`, `F`, `I`, `B`; rely on `ruff format` to normalize imports. Keep configuration isolated to `config.py` and environment variables surfaced in `README.md`.

## Testing Guidelines
Unit tests should mirror module names (`tests/unit/test_<module>.py`) and focus on deterministic behaviors, using fixtures for external services. End-to-end coverage belongs in `tests/e2e` and leverages Playwright; run `make playwright` if Chromium binaries are missing in CI. When adding features, provide both positive and failure-path assertions, and update or regenerate UX artifacts in `UX_TEST_RESULTS.md` if relevant. Surface any non-deterministic dependencies via mocks or fakes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing history: imperative, present-tense summaries under ~72 characters (`Improve error handlingâ€¦`). Reference modules in the body when multiple areas change, and mention associated issue IDs. Each PR should include: a concise description of intent, the primary verification commands (e.g., `make test`, `make lint`), screenshots or data samples for UI/report changes, and notes on migrations or seed updates. Request review only after lint and tests pass locally and documentation (including this guide) is updated as needed.

## Analyst Feedback Loop
Use `python -m src.iva.cli feedback <card_url> "<company>" <discrepancy_type> <action>` to log analyst overrides (actions: `confirm`, `dismiss`, `override`, `escalate`). Provide `--verdict` when the analyst revises the verdict and `--notes` for remediation context. Feedback entries live in `data/feedback/events.jsonl`, while calibration files (`rule_adjustments.json`, `prompt_overrides.md`) regenerate automatically; these paths are ignored by Git, so sync them to shared storage if persistence is required.
