# Iva 2.0 Reality Layer - Executive Briefing Document

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0  
**Status**: Production-Ready Prototype

---

## Executive Summary

**Iva 2.0 Reality Layer** is an AI-native due diligence platform that transforms fintech company verification from a 60-90 minute manual process into an automated 8-12 minute workflow. The system extracts claims from company websites, verifies them against authoritative regulatory sources (NMLS, SEC EDGAR, CFPB, FINTRAC), and generates severity-rated truth cards with exact citations‚Äîdelivering high-confidence findings that flag potential red flags before term sheets are signed.

**Value Proposition**: 70% time reduction in due diligence + proactive risk identification + auditable evidence trail.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Claim Extraction

- **Technology**: GPT-5 Codex (via OpenAI Responses API)
- **Coverage**: Licensing, partner banks, security certifications, compliance programs, financial performance, market positioning, forward-looking statements, business metrics, litigation disclosures
- **Methodology**: Structured extraction from company websites with JavaScript rendering support (Playwright)
- **Output**: Categorized claims with contextual metadata (claim type, category, entities, values)

### 2. Multi-Source Verification Engine

  - Forward-looking statements (safe harbor disclaimers, guidance matching)
  - Litigation (Item 3 disclosure, 8-K filing verification)
  - Business metrics (user counts, merchant counts)
  - Material events (8-K filing compliance)
- `severity.py`: Dynamic severity scoring with analyst feedback adjustments
- `citations.py`: Multi-source confidence calculation (weighted by count, freshness, agreement)

#### Data Models (`src/iva/models/`)
