# Iva Reality Layer — 90-Day Enhancement Proposal

**TO:** Impression Ventures Partnership | **FROM:** [Your Name] | **DATE:** October 23, 2025

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

I propose building a **Reality Layer** for your Iva that automates fintech compliance verification — transforming what currently takes 60-90 minutes of manual research into a <10-minute, AI-powered workflow with cited evidence.

**The Problem:** Partners spend hours manually verifying licenses (NMLS, FINTRAC), sponsor bank claims, and security certifications. Red flags discovered post-term sheet cost time and credibility.

**The Solution:** An automated claim-to-fact reconciliation engine that extracts claims from company websites and verifies them against authoritative sources (NMLS, SEC EDGAR, CFPB, bank partner pages), delivering severity-rated truth cards with confidence scores and exact citations for IC memos.

## WHAT IT VERIFIES & HOW IT WORKS

| **Verification Area** | **Sources Checked** | **Output** |
|---|---|---|
| **Licenses & Registrations** | NMLS, FINTRAC, SEC EDGAR, state regulators | Missing licenses, inactive states |
| **Sponsor Bank Claims** | Bank partner pages, press releases, integration proof | Unverified partnerships, PR mismatches |
| **Security Posture** | SOC 2, trust centers, security.txt, TLS config | Missing certifications, unsubstantiated claims |
| **Regulatory Interactions** | CFPB complaints, SEC actions, state notices | Enforcement actions, complaint patterns |

**Pipeline:** Ingest (scrape website) → Extract (GPT-5codex identifies claims) → Verify (query sources via adapters) → Reconcile (chatgpt5thinking flags discrepancies with severity ratings) → Report (Slack card + HTML memo)

**Confidence Methodology:** 
- 3+ independent sources = high confidence
- Data <90 days old weighted higher
- Severity elevated for licensing gaps and partner mismatches

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

```
🛑 High Severity • 88% Confidence
Claim: "Licensed in 30 states"
Found: NMLS shows 14 active MTLs (updated 3 months ago)
Expected: NMLS roster with 30 state licenses
Sources: [1] NMLS Consumer Access [2] Company website
Checked: 2025-10-23

⚠️ Medium Severity • 76% Confidence  
Claim: "SOC 2 Type II certified"
Found: No trust center or auditor letter; security.txt missing
Expected: Trust center with auditor letter
Sources: [1] Site crawl [2] SSL/TLS check
Checked: 2025-10-23

🛑 High Severity • 91% Confidence
Claim: "Partnered with Bank X as sponsor"
Found: Bank X partner page doesn't list company
Expected: Partner page listing or joint press release
Sources: [1] bankx.com/partners [2] News archives
Checked: 2025-10-23

Overall: 82% confidence • 3 sources • All <90 days
Suggested outreach: "Could you share your NMLS roster and SOC 2 letter?"
```

## PROOF OF CONCEPT

**I've already built a working prototype to validate feasibility:**

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Your Replit URL] — Click "Try Demo" to test with Stripe/Plaid/any fintech  
🔗 **GitHub:** [Your Repo URL] — Full source code with architecture

**Tech Stack:** FastAPI + GPT-5codex (extraction) + chatgpt5thinking (reasoning) + Playwright (JS rendering) + multi-source adapters

**What it demonstrates:** End-to-end pipeline (URL → truth card in <10 min), production web UI, Slack-compatible output, cited sources with timestamps

## 90-DAY DELIVERY PLAN

| **Weeks** | **Milestone** | **Integration with Your Systems** |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| **1-2** | Golden dataset + taxonomy | Map to your 8K company database; align claim categories with investment thesis |
| **3-4** | Live adapters (NMLS, banks) | Replace prototype stubs with real-time APIs; rate limit handling |
| **5-6** | Reconciliation + Slack | Connect to your DFMS; auto-post truth cards to deal channels |
| **7-8** | Pilot + calibration | Test on 10 active deals; tune severity thresholds with partner feedback |
| **9-10** | Memo generator | Format for your IC template; export to PDF/Markdown |
| **11-12** | Production deployment | VPC + audit logs + PII redaction + robots.txt compliance |

---

## EXPECTED IMPACT

| **Metric** | **Target** | **How Measured** |
|---|---|---|
| **Time savings** | 70% reduction (60-90 min → <10 min) | Average across 100 companies |
| **Precision** | 10-20% higher precision@K | A/B test vs. manual screening |
| **Accuracy** | ≥85% partner-confirmed on high-severity flags | Validation in follow-up calls |
| **Risk reduction** | -20% late-stage red flags | Measured across deal flow |

**Today:** Manual Google searches, PDF downloads, calling references  
**With Reality Layer:** Paste URL → receive cited truth card in <10 minutes

## WHAT I BRING

**Technical:** Built the prototype end-to-end; deep experience with OpenAI API, LangChain, FastAPI, Playwright  
**Domain:** Understand fintech compliance (NMLS, sponsor banks, SOC 2) and what constitutes IC-ready evidence  
**Mindset:** Prototype first, iterate on feedback; obsessed with reducing friction

I've built this because I'm genuinely excited about making venture capital more systematic. I'd love to build it with you.
