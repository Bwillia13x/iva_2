# Iva Reality Layer — 90-Day Enhancement Proposal

**TO:** Impression Ventures Partnership  
**FROM:** [Your Name]  
**RE:** AI Venture Analyst Application - Proposed Enhancement  
**DATE:** October 23, 2025

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Your Iva currently excels at initial deal screening. I propose building a **Reality Layer** capability that would transform Iva from a deal screener into a **compliance verification engine** — automatically fact-checking fintech companies' licensing, banking partnerships, and security claims against authoritative regulatory sources.

This enhancement would enable Iva to deliver cited, severity-rated truth cards in under 10 minutes, turning what currently takes 60-90 minutes of manual research into an automated, auditable workflow.

---

## THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES

**Current pain points in fintech due diligence:**

- Partners spend **60-90 minutes** manually verifying licenses across NMLS, FINTRAC, and state regulators
- Sponsor bank claims require manual cross-referencing of partner pages and press releases
- Security certifications (SOC 2, ISO) often go unverified until late-stage DD
- No systematic way to cite evidence for IC memos
- Red flags discovered post-term sheet cost time and credibility

**Impact:** Deals slip through screening with compliance issues that surface weeks later, or promising companies get passed over due to incomplete verification.

---

## THE SOLUTION: REALITY LAYER FOR IVA

A complementary verification module that augments Iva's screening with automated claim-to-fact reconciliation:

### What It Verifies

<table>
<tr>
<td width="25%">

**Licenses & Registrations**

NMLS, FINTRAC, SEC EDGAR filings, state registrations

</td>
<td width="25%">

**Sponsor Bank Claims**

Partner bank pages, joint press releases, integration evidence

</td>
<td width="25%">

**Security Posture**

SOC 2, trust centers, security.txt, TLS configuration

</td>
<td width="25%">

**Regulatory Interactions**

CFPB complaints, SEC actions, state regulatory notices

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### How It Works

**1. Ingest** — Scrape company website with JavaScript rendering support (Playwright)  
**2. Extract** — Use GPT-5codex to identify specific claims about licenses, partners, certifications  
**3. Verify** — Query authoritative sources via purpose-built adapters (NMLS API, SEC EDGAR, CFPB, bank partner pages)  
**4. Reconcile** — Use chatgpt5thinking to identify discrepancies with severity ratings and confidence scores  
**5. Report** — Generate Slack cards + HTML memos with exact citations (URLs, timestamps, query parameters)

### Methodology & Confidence

**Confidence is driven by:**
- Source diversity (3+ independent sources = high confidence)
- Recency (data from last 90 days weighted higher)
- Source agreement across multiple channels

**Severity is higher for:**
- Licensing and registration gaps (regulatory risk)
- Partner bank relationship discrepancies (GTM validation)
- Security certification claims without evidence (customer trust risk)

## PROOF OF CONCEPT

**To validate technical feasibility, I've already built a working prototype:**

🔗 **Live Demo:** [Your Replit URL]  
🔗 **GitHub:** [Your Repo URL]  
🔗 **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, GPT-5codex, chatgpt5thinking, Playwright, multi-source adapters

**The prototype demonstrates:**
- ✅ End-to-end pipeline (company URL → cited truth card in <10 minutes)
- ✅ Multi-source adapter architecture (NMLS, SEC EDGAR, CFPB, bank partners, news)
- ✅ LLM orchestration (structured extraction + AI reasoning)
- ✅ Production-ready web interface with real-time results
- ✅ Export to JSON, HTML memos, and Slack-compatible format

**Click "Try Demo" to test with Stripe, Plaid, or any fintech URL.**

## LIVE DEMO SNAPSHOT

**Example output for a fintech company:**

```
🛑 High Severity • 88% Confidence
Claim: "Licensed in 30 states"
Found: NMLS shows 14 active MTLs (last update 3 months ago)
Expected evidence: NMLS roster export showing 30 state licenses
Checked: 2025-10-23 • Sources: [1] NMLS Consumer Access [2] Company website

⚠️ Medium Severity • 76% Confidence  
Claim: "SOC 2 Type II certified"
Found: No trust center or auditor letter; security.txt missing; TLS configuration ok
Expected evidence: Trust center with auditor letter or third-party seal
Checked: 2025-10-23 • Sources: [1] Site crawl [2] SSL/TLS check [3] Trust seal verification

🛑 High Severity • 91% Confidence
Claim: "Partnered with Bank X as sponsor"
Found: Bank X partner page doesn't list company; no joint press release found
Expected evidence: Bank partner page listing or joint press announcement
Checked: 2025-10-23 • Sources: [1] bankx.com/partners [2] News archives [3] PR database

Overall Confidence: 82% (from 3 independent sources, all verified within 90 days)

Why it matters: Compliance risk + GTM validation gap

Suggested outreach: "Could you share your latest NMLS license roster and SOC 2 
audit letter? If in progress, what's your Type I/II timeline?"
```

**Advisory only — not legal advice. All findings include exact source URLs, query params, and timestamps for audit trail.**

## 90-DAY DELIVERY PLAN

**Integration with your existing Iva infrastructure:**

| Weeks | Milestone | Deliverable |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **1-2** | Golden dataset + taxonomy | Integrate with your 8,000-company database; define claim categories aligned with your investment thesis |
| **3-4** | Live NMLS + bank-partner adapters | Replace prototype stubs with real-time API integrations; add error handling for rate limits |
| **5-6** | Reconciliation engine + Slack integration | Connect to your DFMS (Deal Flow Management System); auto-post truth cards to deal-specific channels |
| **7-8** | Calibration with pilot companies | Test on 10 active pipeline companies; A/B test against manual research; tune severity thresholds |
| **9-10** | Memo generator | Format outputs for your IC presentation template; add export to PDF/Markdown |
| **11-12** | Production deployment + audit logs | VPC deployment with logging; PII redaction; robots.txt compliance; opt-out handling |

## WHAT IT'S NOT

⚠️ **Advisory signal only** — Not legal advice or a comprehensive background check  
⚠️ **Verification assistant** — Always confirm critical findings with direct sources before term sheets  
⚠️ **Regulatory filing** — Outputs are for internal diligence, not regulatory submissions

Think of it as a **smart research assistant** that gives you a 10-minute head start with cited evidence, not a replacement for deep due diligence.

---

## INTEGRATION POINTS WITH YOUR WORKFLOW

**Inputs:**
- Deal flow from your DFMS (Salesforce/Airtable/custom)
- Company URLs from intake forms
- Jurisdictions from deal metadata

**Outputs:**

## NEXT STEPS

**If this aligns with your vision for Iva:**

1. **Test the prototype:** Click through the live demo with 2-3 fintech companies you know well
2. **Calibration call:** I'd love to show you the architecture and discuss integration with your DFMS
3. **Pilot proposal:** Run Reality Layer on 10 active pipeline companies to validate accuracy

I've built this because I believe AI can fundamentally change how venture capital operates. I'd love to build it with you.
