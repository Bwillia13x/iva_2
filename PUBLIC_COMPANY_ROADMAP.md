## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Free SEC API**: Using official `data.sec.gov` API (free, no auth required)
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second maximum per SEC requirements
- **User-Agent**: Must include contact email in all SEC API requests
- **Caching**: Will cache SEC responses to minimize API calls

### Key Constraints
- SEC API requires User-Agent header with contact info
- Must respect 10 req/sec rate limit
- XBRL data can be complex - may need multiple parsing strategies
- Some filings are HTML, some are XBRL, some are PDF

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we cache SEC filings locally or fetch fresh each time?
- [ ] How far back in filing history should we look?
- [ ] Should we support international stock exchanges (LSE, TSX, etc.)?
- [ ] What's the UX for companies with multiple tickers?
