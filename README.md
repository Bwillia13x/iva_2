## 🎯 What It Does

**The Problem**: Venture capital partners spend 60-90 minutes manually verifying fintech licensing claims, sponsor bank relationships, and security certifications. Red flags discovered post-term sheet cost time and credibility.

**The Solution**: Iva transforms fintech due diligence from a manual, time-consuming process into an automated, AI-powered workflow that delivers results in under 10 minutes:

1. **📥 Ingest** – Scrapes company websites (with JavaScript rendering support via Playwright)
2. **🔍 Extract** – Uses GPT-5codex to identify licensing, partner-bank, and compliance claims
3. **✅ Verify** – Queries authoritative sources (NMLS, FINTRAC, EDGAR, CFPB, bank partner lists)
4. **⚖️ Reconcile** – AI reasoning (chatgpt5thinking) identifies discrepancies with severity ratings
5. **📊 Report** – Generates truth cards and detailed HTML memos with exact citations

**Result**: High-confidence, severity-rated truth cards that flag potential red flags in seconds, not days.

### Tech Stack

**Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with async/await  
**AI/LLM**: OpenAI API (GPT-5codex for extraction, chatgpt5thinking for reasoning)  
**Web Scraping**: Playwright (JS rendering), BeautifulSoup4, Trafilatura  
**Templating**: Jinja2 for dynamic HTML reports  
**Optional**: PostgreSQL + pgvector, Neo4j (disabled by default)

### Why This Stack?

- **FastAPI**: High-performance async framework perfect for I/O-bound operations (web scraping + API calls)
- **GPT-5codex**: Optimized for structured data extraction from unstructured web content
- **chatgpt5thinking**: Advanced reasoning for nuanced claim reconciliation and severity assessment
- **Playwright**: Handles JavaScript-rendered SPAs that traditional scrapers miss
- **Modular Adapters**: Each data source is isolated, making it easy to add new regulators or jurisdictions

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Advisory Only**: All outputs are advisory and not legal advice
- **Respect robots.txt**: Scraper respects website policies and rate limits
- **API Costs**: OpenAI API calls incur costs (~$0.50-$2 per analysis depending on website size)
- **Prototype Stage**: Some adapters use stubbed data (clearly marked as "MVP stub" in code)
- **PII Handling**: No customer PII is stored; all data is transient unless databases are enabled
- **Audit Trail**: All outputs include exact source URLs, query parameters, and timestamps

---

- [ ] Batch processing (analyze 50+ companies in parallel)
- [ ] Enhanced severity logic (partner-specific thresholds)

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Weeks 9-12)
- [ ] Professional PDF export with branding
- [ ] RESTful API for programmatic access
- [ ] Analytics dashboard (trends, false positive analysis)
- [ ] VPC deployment with audit logs
- [ ] DFMS integration (deal flow management systems)

### Why This Matters

In an industry where **60-90 minutes of manual verification** is the norm, Iva represents a **10x improvement** in efficiency. But speed alone isn't the goal—it's about **confidence**. Every finding includes:
- ✅ Exact source citations with URLs
- ✅ Confidence scores driven by multi-source validation
- ✅ Severity ratings calibrated to investment risk
- ✅ Timestamps proving data freshness

This isn't just automation. It's **AI-native due diligence** that augments—not replaces—human judgment.
