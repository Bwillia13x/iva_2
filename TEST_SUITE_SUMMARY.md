   - Timeout handling

### Existing Tests (Updated)

1. **test_reconcile.py** - Basic reconciliation tests (UTC import fixed)
2. **test_press_metrics.py** - Press metrics adapter tests (UTC import fixed)
3. **test_claims.py** - Basic claim model tests

### End-to-End Tests (Updated)

1. **test_pipeline.py** - Full pipeline integration test (UTC import fixed)

## Test Coverage

### Components Tested
- ✅ Data models (claims, recon, sources)
- ✅ Reconciliation engine (comprehensive edge cases)
- ✅ Severity calculation
- ✅ Citation confidence calculation
- ✅ Alert monitoring system
- ✅ API endpoints
- ✅ Ingestion module (fetch/parse)
- ✅ Basic adapter tests (press_metrics)

### Components Needing Additional Tests
- ⚠️ Adapters (nmls, edgar, cfpb, bank_partners, trust_center, news, etc.) - Basic structure exists but comprehensive mocking needed
- ⚠️ CLI commands - Need integration tests
- ⚠️ LLM client - Need mocking tests
- ⚠️ Export functionality (PDF) - Partially tested via API
- ⚠️ Learning/feedback system - Needs tests

## Python Version Requirement

**Important**: The application requires Python 3.11+ due to the use of `datetime.UTC`. The test suite has been written to work with Python 3.11+.

To run tests:
```bash
# Using Python 3.11+
python3.11 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Or using make (if Python 3.11+ is default)
make test
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v

# Run with coverage
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/ --cov=src/iva --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Run only e2e tests
PYTHONPATH=. pytest tests/e2e/ -v
```

## Test Results Summary

### Passing Tests (Python 3.11+)
- ✅ All model validation tests
- ✅ All severity calculation tests
- ✅ All citation confidence tests
- ✅ All basic reconciliation tests
- ✅ All claim model tests

### Tests Requiring Python 3.11+
- ⚠️ API endpoint tests (require FastAPI test client)
- ⚠️ Alert tests (require alert module imports)
- ⚠️ Comprehensive reconciliation tests (require engine imports)
- ⚠️ Ingestion tests (require playwright)

## Notes

1. **UTC Import**: All test files use `timezone.utc` for compatibility, but source code files require Python 3.11+ for `datetime.UTC`. Consider updating source code to use `timezone.utc` for broader compatibility, or ensure Python 3.11+ is used.

2. **Mocking**: Many tests use mocks to avoid external dependencies. Integration tests that require actual API calls or external services should be marked appropriately.

3. **Async Tests**: Tests use `pytest-asyncio` for async function testing. Ensure `pytest-asyncio` is installed.

4. **Test Isolation**: Tests are designed to be independent and can run in any order. Use temporary directories for file-based tests.

## Next Steps

1. Fix Python version compatibility (either update source to use `timezone.utc` or document Python 3.11+ requirement)
2. Add comprehensive adapter tests with proper mocking
3. Add CLI integration tests
4. Add LLM client mocking tests
5. Add learning/feedback system tests
6. Set up CI/CD with Python 3.11+
7. Generate coverage report and identify gaps
