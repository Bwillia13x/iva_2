Subject: AI Venture Analyst Application (via Startup & VC) — Drew Williams | Iva Reality Layer demo

Dear Impression Ventures Team,

I’m applying for the AI Venture Analyst role (via Startup & VC). I’m a builder who ships, and I’ve already prototyped the 90-day capability I’d add to Iva: the Reality Layer—an automated claim-to-fact verifier for fintechs.

What it does
- Extracts licensing, partner-bank, and security claims from company materials
- Verifies against authoritative sources (NMLS, FINTRAC, SEC EDGAR, CFPB, sponsor bank pages, trust centers)
- Reconciles discrepancies with LLM reasoning
- Outputs severity-rated “truth cards” with confidence scores and exact citations

Impact
- Reduces 60–90 minutes of manual research to under 10 minutes
- Improves pre-meeting triage, strengthens IC memo evidence, and surfaces red flags earlier (e.g., licensing gaps, overstated partner claims, SOC 2 claims without auditor proof)

See it
- Live demo: https://iva-2-bdrewwilliams.replit.app/ (click “Try Demo” to test with Stripe, Plaid, or any fintech)
- GitHub: https://github.com/Bwillia13x/iva_2

Tech stack
- FastAPI, Playwright for JS rendering
- OpenAI models for structured extraction and reasoning
- Multi-source adapter pattern, ready to scale across your 8,000-company dataset

I’ve attached a one-page 90-day implementation memo and my resume. I’d welcome a short walkthrough to discuss how this slots into Iva’s evolution.

Best,
Drew Williams
